# TODO

- [ ] Appearance: customize layout and UIKit.
- [ ] Dash: DataTable filtering, more info, DAQ widgets, etc.
- [ ] Incorporate a workflow to automate updates.
- [ ] Directory structure and filename standards: both are a mess.
- [ ] General cleanup: there are a lot of deprecated files from Flask and JSON I/Os.
- [ ] Refactor xl_py.main() without so many loops. Just write the lists all at once.
- [x] Expand the data constructions towards pandas and away from JSON.
